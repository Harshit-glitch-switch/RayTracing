# RayTracing

A simple **Ray Tracing** project written in **C++** using the book *Ray Tracing in One Weekend* as a guide.  
This project aims to learn the fundamentals of computer graphics, rendering, and ray tracing from scratch.

---

## 📖 Project Overview
Ray tracing is a rendering technique for generating an image by tracing the path of light as pixels in an image plane.  
This project implements:
- Vectors and colors
- Ray-sphere intersections
- Camera setup
- Diffuse and reflective materials
- Outputting rendered images (PPM format)

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Language**: C++  
- **Libraries**:  
  - [SDL2](https://www.libsdl.org/) (for rendering window)  
- **Tools**: Visual Studio  

---

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Harshit-glitch-switch/RayTracing.git
Open the project in Visual Studio.

Build and run.

The output will be displayed in a window.
